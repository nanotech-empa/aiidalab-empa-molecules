# Empa nanotech@surfaces Laboratory - Molecules

App to compute molecular properties.

## Installation

This Jupyter-based app is intended to be run with [AiiDAlab](https://www.materialscloud.org/aiidalab).

Assuming that the app was registered, you can install it directly via the app store in AiiDAlab or on the command line with:
```
aiidalab install aiidalab-empa-molecules
```
Otherwise, you can also install it directly from the repository:
```
aiidalab install aiidalab-empa-molecules@git+https://github.com/nanotech-empa/aiidalab-empa-molecules.git
```

## For maintainers

To create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update`.
This will:

  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.
  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release.

Additional notes:

  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.
  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.
    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.
